# COVID-19 Baseline

Code for the baseline scenario from the paper ["Modelling the impact of testing, contact tracing and household quarantine on second waves of COVID-19"](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0931-9).

## Input

There are three files in the Data folder:

- network.txt: network* edge list in the format *Source Target Weight*. The code assumes that the edge list is directed.
- nodes.txt: two-column file in the format *id age_group*. There are five age_groups: 0 [0-4], 1 [5-17], 2 [18-49], 3 [50-64], 4 [65,+)
- parameters_0.txt: file containing all the model parameters, see the paper for further details. Most parameters should be fixed, except for the first one (N, number of nodes) and the last one (beta, transmission probability). The transmission probability should be calibrated depending on the weights of the network under consideration to achieve the desired value of R0.

*Note: the original code was fed with mobility data obtained from a private company (see the paper for further details). The code in this repository is a simplified version that runs the baseline scenario on a random network with N=10.000 and \<k>=10.

## Usage

If the gnu scientific library is installed in the system, simply run
```
make
```
and then
```
./seir
```
This will produce 2 text files in the Results folder:

- cum_baseline_p0.txt: cumulative number of individuals in each state at the end of the simulation
- data_baseline_p0.txt: number of individuals in each state at each time step
